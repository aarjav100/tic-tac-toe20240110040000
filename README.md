Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, is a simple and widely recognized two-player game. It is typically played on a 3x3 grid, where players alternate turns marking a square with their symbol: one player uses "X" and the other uses "O". The gameâ€™s objective is to align three of the same symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
